### **Short About-me Description**

Hi, I’m Troy, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Communication, Culture, and Technology at Georgetown University. With a background in Film and Media Studies from Jinan University, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of media, technology, and computational analysis. My interests span across computer vision, generative AI, and computational communication. I enjoy tackling complex challenges through continuous learning, collaborating with people from a variety of backgrounds, and applying both creative and technical skills to real-world projects. Through this website, I aim to share my journey in learning computer science, mathematics, and media studies while fostering an intellectual community of curious minds.

This strength drives me to set clear goals and maintain a positive feedback loop of progress. For instance, every morning I list out tasks and steadily work through them, which ensures I stay on top of my priorities.


#### Focus
With Focus, I am able to set long-term goals and follow through with a detailed, step-by-step approach.

Since last year, I’ve dedicated myself to building an AI-driven platform to generate films, learning daily to ensure consistent progress toward this ambitious project.

#### Activator
Being an Activator means I take action swiftly.

When I realized that my project required extensive Computer Science knowledge, I immediately enrolled in two challenging CS courses, Algorithms and Foundations of Machine Learning, without hesitating.

#### Learner
As a Learner, I am driven by the process of continuous improvement.

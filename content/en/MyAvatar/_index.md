The tree is made from wax sticks and tape, with various signs attached, each symbolizing limitations or prohibitions in human society. \
According to Lacan's theory, these rules are created by the ruling class to maintain control, forming what he calls the *The University Discourse*. The signs define certain boundaries but also confine the concepts they represent. However, (r)evolution happens within the tension between following and resisting these rules. \
The apple hanging from the tree symbolizes enlightenment—it falls from this *Tree of Taboos* and strikes the thinker below, represented by the bear reading a book. This bear symbolizes those who challenge the current symbolic order through learning. By exploring what hasn’t been named or defined (Lacan's *objet a*), they drive the process of (r)evolution, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and leading to new discoveries and progress.

"I can only see from one point, but in my existence, I *am seen* from all directions — this is the nature of humans as symbolic beings, constrained by language. Human desire is the desire of *the Other*. Human desire must be fulfilled through *negation*. The structure of desire is founded on *lack*; without *transgression*, one cannot achieve *jouissance*." \
— *Lacan*

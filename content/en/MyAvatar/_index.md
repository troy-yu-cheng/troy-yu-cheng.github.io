### **Avatar Description**  (150words)
The tree, covered with various signs, symbolizes the growing limitations and prohibitions that arise in human societal development. These restrictions form the *Symbolic Order*, shaping what Lacan calls *the University Discourse*. (R)evolution happens within the tension between following and resisting this *Order*.

The apple hanging from the tree symbolizes enlightenment—it falls from this *Tree of Taboos* and strikes the thinker below, represented by the bear reading a book. This bear symbolizes those who challenge the current symbolic order through learning. By exploring what hasn’t been named or defined (Lacan's *objet a*), they drive the process of (r)evolution, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and leading to new discoveries and progress. \
The Avatar's strength is its visualization of the restrictive environment where (r)evolution occurs and its symbolism of knowledge as key to change. However, it lacks representation of opposing forces or the concrete process of (r)evolution.

"I can only see from one point, but in my existence, I *am seen* from all directions — this is the nature of humans as symbolic beings, constrained by language. Human desire is the desire of *the Other*. Human desire must be fulfilled through *negation*. The structure of desire is founded on *lack*; without *transgression*, one cannot achieve *jouissance*." \
— *Lacan*

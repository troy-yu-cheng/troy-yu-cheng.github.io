# About Me
Hello, I am Troy!

## 1)Achiever

	You work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. You take immense satisfaction in being busy and
productive.	Consistently complete tasks, setting and achieving goals; establish a positive feedback system.	This morning, I listed 11 tasks I needed to complete in my notebook (as I do every morning) and successfully completed the first two.

## 2)Focus

	You can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. You
prioritize, then act.	Set a long-term goal, filter distractions, focus on step-by-step, down-to-earth missions, and steadily work toward them.	Since last year, I have been focused on my project to build an AI-driven platform to generate films. I continue to learn relevant knowledge and stay updated on developments in this field daily.

3)Activator

	You can make things happen by turning thoughts into action. You want to do things now, rather than simply talk about them.	Make quick decisions and take action without hesitating(May be a bit impulsive or lacking in consideration at times).	I realized that my project requires a significant amount of Computer Science knowledge, so I took immediate action by leveraging non-CCT resources to successfully enroll in two CS electives: Algorithms and Foundations of ML.


4)Learner

	You have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites you.	Walk out of my comfort zone, stay curious, continuously explore new knowledge, challenge my ignorance and keep improving.	As a non-STEM student, learning CS courses and related math is challenging, but it motivates me to keep learning and exploring every day, even if the questions I struggle with seem basic to my CS classmates and professors.
5)Relator




	You enjoy close relationships with others. You find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.	Assemble an expedition team, build deep trust in relationships and achieve common goals through teamwork and collaboration.	I teamed up with a CS classmate, and we are currently researching GAN algorithms for images. Weâ€™re co-writing a thesis to solve the issue of maintaining character consistency in generative AI for images and videos.

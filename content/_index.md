I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Film and Media Studies from the School of Arts, [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/). I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in [Communication, Culture, and Technology at Georgetown University](https://cct.georgetown.edu/). This website is built using GitHub Pages and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and features content in both Chinese and English. I will be continuously updating the site with my self-taught knowledge in computer science, mathematics, and other subjects, serving as a personal study archive while sharing with others. Feel free to leave comments on my posts (you’ll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account)—perhaps we can inspire each other!

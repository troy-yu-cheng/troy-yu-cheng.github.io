# My blog

This is the repository of my blog, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).


This website is built using GitHub Pages and Hugo , and features content in both Chinese and English. I will be continuously updating the site with my self-taught knowledge in computer science, mathematics, and other subjects, serving as a personal study archive while sharing with others. Feel free to leave comments on my posts (you’ll need a GitHub account)—perhaps we can inspire each other!
